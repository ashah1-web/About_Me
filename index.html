    <h3>Volunteering at the EBPL (East Brunswick Public Library)</h3>
    <p>I have been volunteering at the EBPL for about 2 years. I volunteer in a program called Geek League. In Geek League I help out senior citizens with their technology issues. I have learned how to communicate better and ask questions when I don't know how to approach an issue. Also, it is a good feeling to have knowing that you helped someone out. As I am entering my junior year, I am now eligible to become a board member of Geek League. I plan on becoming a board member and continuning to take larger roles.</p>
