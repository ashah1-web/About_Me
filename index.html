    <h2>Volunteering at the EBPL (East Brunswick Public Library)</h2>
    <p>I have been volunteering at the EBPL for about 2 years. I volunteer in a program called Geek League. In Geek League I help out senior citizens with their technology issues. I have learned how to communicate better and ask questions when I don't know how to approach an issue. Also, it is a good feeling to have knowing that you have helped someone out. As I am entering my junior year, I am now eligible to become a board member of Geek League. I plan on becoming a board member and continuning to take larger roles.</p>

    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>I have been playing team organized basketball for about 5 years. I play in a local league called Fast Break. Fast Break is popular rec basketball league in East Brunswick. Throughout the years at Fast Break, I have met many people on new teams and some of those people are now my friends. It is pretty fun playing with others as a team and winning games together. In terms of on the court, I have established myself as one of the better defenders and a good shooter. I can shoot the ball from any range, 3 point range or mid range. The one thing I haven't accomplished in Fast Break is winning the championship. The teams I have been a part of have been very close, but we never won.</p>

    <h2>Piano</h2>
    <p>I started playing piano at the age of 5. I was taught by a local piano teacher named Mr. Mao. I performed at recitals every year from the age of 5 to the age of 14. Performing at recitals from a young age taught me to be confident and how to deal with nerves. I learned how to play high difficulty level music. I even played difficult music at recitals. However, I had to quit playing at recitals given that I didn't have the time to practice playing more difficult music. Despite this, I still play the piano for fun and I recently taught myself how to play newer and more popular songs.</p>
