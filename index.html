    <h3>Volunteering at the EBPL (East Brunswick Public Library)</h3>
    <p>I have been volunteering at the EBPL for about 2 years. I volunteer in a program called Geek League. In Geek League I help out senior citizens with their technology issues. I have learned how to communicate better and ask questions when I don't know how to approach an issue. Also, it is a good feeling to have knowing that you have helped someone out. As I am entering my junior year, I am now eligible to become a board member of Geek League. I plan on becoming a board member and continuning to take larger roles.</p>

    <h3>Basketball</h3>
    <p>I have been playing team organized basketball for about 5 years. I play in a local league called Fast Break. Fast Break is popular rec basketball league in East Brunswick. Throughout the years at Fast Break, I have met many people on new teams and some of those people are now my friends. It is pretty fun playing with others as team and winning games together. In terms of on the court, I have established myself as one of the better defenders and a good shooter. I can shoot the ball from any range, 3 point range or mid range. The one thing I haven't accomplished in Fast Break is winning the championship. The teams I have been a part of have been very close, but we never won. Hopefully, I am able to win a Fast Break championship before high school is over.</p>
