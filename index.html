    <h2>Volunteering at the East Brunswick Public Library</h2>
    <p>I have been volunteering at the EBPL for about 3 years. I volunteer in a program called Geek League. In Geek League I help out senior citizens with their technology issues. I have learned how to communicate better and ask questions when I don't know how to approach an issue. Also, it is a good feeling to have knowing that you have helped someone out. This year we couldn't help patrons in person due to the pandemic. But, we instead made videos about apps and posted them all the library's website for people to view. </p>

    <h2>Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA)</h2>
    <p>I have been part of FBLA for a year. Getting into this club was difficult because of how competitive tryouts are. To get into FBLA I presented a presentation about the NBA's plan for the 2020-2021 season. In FBLA, I competed in the coffee shop game event twice and placed in the top 5 both times. Additionally, I competed in the states event and I made a public service announcement about vaping. </p>

    <h2>Piano</h2>
    <p>I started playing piano at the age of 5. I was taught by a local piano teacher named Mr. Mao. I performed at recitals every year from the age of 5 to the age of 14. Performing at recitals from a young age taught me to be confident and how to deal with nerves. I learned how to play high difficulty level music. I even played difficult music at recitals. </p>
